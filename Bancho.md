## What is Bancho?

Bancho is a server, that was developed for most of the **in-game player interactions**, like:

- Login
- Chat/IRC
- Multiplayer
- Spectating
- Friends
- Real-time Player Stats

and more!

Nowadays the client will use a **HTTPS** connection to interact with Bancho under [c.ppy.sh](https://c.ppy.sh/),
but back then [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/peppy) used a **TCP server** to handle client connections.

To **learn more** about the technical details, get started on [[Protocol|this page]].
